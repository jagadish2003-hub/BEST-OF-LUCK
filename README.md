HTML Structure:

The page displays a moon with craters, a canvas for animations (likely fireworks based on the JavaScript code), and a beach scene with a jumping person image.
The interactive part is a gift box that prompts the user to click on it, likely triggering a surprise animation or reveal based on the script.
The text "BEST OF LUCK" and other messages appear animatedly on the screen, styled with a neon effect.
CSS Styling:

The background transitions with a gradient resembling a sunset or beach sky.
The moon and its craters are created with circular shapes using border-radius.
There are a lot of animations, especially with text elements and the gift box, adding wobbling and flying effects to make it dynamic.
A radial gradient for the sea and beach gives a realistic scene setup.
The animation keyframes are defined for different elements like text shadows, and there are media queries for responsiveness.
JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript sets up a fireworks animation on the canvas, where fireworks are launched either automatically or when clicked.
The fireworks' movement, speed, and brightness are controlled through the Firework constructor and its update function.
The canvas is made fullscreen, and the mouse click coordinates are used to target where fireworks will appear.
Suggestions:
Canvas Resizing: You might want to add an event listener for window resizing to adjust the canvas size dynamically.
Add Interaction: Consider adding more interaction to the gift box to make the surprise element more engaging, such as revealing a hidden message or animation after clicking.
